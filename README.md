Heavily in alpha. Approaching a point of testing, feedback, and input if you would like to get involved.

[some progress posted to twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=bramble%20from%3Aanimalphase&src=typd)

A native desktop app running in Electron. Started from this boilerplate: https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate

---

## Installation

Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the folder.

---

## Usage

#### Running in dev mode:

This starts the renderer process in hot-module-replacement mode and starts a server sends hot updates to the renderer process (seems like this only needs to be run once?):

`$ npm run dev`

Run these two commands simultaneously in different console tabs to initiate dev rendering & hot-swap:

- `$ npm run hot-updates-server`

- `$ npm run start-hot-renderer`

---

## Contribute

### // TODO

 - In `state-return.js`, create an option that returns only relevant properties for rendering SVG arrows.
 - Add HTML export functionality.
 - Reorganize how projects are saved to include local media and other future user-generated assets.
 - Have new patches created in a context-informed location.
 - Add ability to move through link destinations by using arrow keys.
 - Move keypresses to Electron API.
